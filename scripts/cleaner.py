    RAPID MESSAGE CLEANER SCRIPT
    -------------------------
    
    This script provides a quick way to clean up your recent messages in a channel.
    It automatically finds and deletes messages you've sent in the past 3 minutes.
    
    FEATURES:
    - Rapid message deletion
    - Only deletes your own messages
    - Status updates during cleanup
    - Rate-limited to avoid API throttling
    - Error handling for failed deletions
    - Auto-deleting status messages
    
    COMMANDS:
    <p>clean    - Start cleaning messages from the past 3 minutes
    
    EXAMPLE USAGE:
    <p>clean    - "üßπ Starting message cleanup..."
                - "‚úÖ Cleanup complete! Deleted 5 messages from the past minute."
    
    BEHAVIOR:
    - Searches last 100 messages in the channel
    - Only deletes messages from past 3 minutes
    - 0.5 second delay between deletions
    - Status message auto-deletes after 5 seconds
    
    NOTES:
    - Only affects your own messages
    - Status messages are temporary
    - Safe to use in any channel
